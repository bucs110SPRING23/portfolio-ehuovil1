# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*

This program involves using 2 API's, one of them returns your current latitude and longitude coordinates, and the other takes those as parameters to return nearby city weather location. I coded my program so that it prints out current latitude and longitude, it then prints out current wind speed and current city from those coordinates, to which it then judges and prints out a message saying whether it is good conditions to fly a plane or a kite.
